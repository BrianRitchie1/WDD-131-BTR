The second page will have a sort by number and alphebetical feature, which will be more helpful if you dont know the number of the meme.</p>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			Palette URL:

			<h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>I choose Roboto because it is easy to understand and easy to use.</p>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Roboto

			<h3>Navigation</h3>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>[<p>Here is some of the content that will go on the site</p>
            <img src="images/chicka.png">
            <img src="images/gangnambaby.jpg">
            <img src="images/raiden.png">
            <p>This pitcure is a picture a man who looks like raiden from metal gear solid 2, who happens to mogging. When this topic is discussed, this is funny because raiden takes himself far to serious to mog, even though his game is very silly</p>
            <p>"This meme orginates from a video of a man trying to be sexy, on to be animated into the animatrioncs from the popular game FNAF. The irony is in the fact that the animatronics are trying to kill you, not attact you. While the most popular version of this meme is with Chica, it can be mixed with any of the animatronics."</p></p>
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>A total list instead of a selector</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
                <img src="images/WDD FINAL WIREFRAME 1.PNG" alt="wireframe">
            <img src="images/WDD FINAL WIREFRAME 2 Mobile.PNG" alt="wireframe">
            <img src="images/WDD FINAL WIREFRAME 2.PNG" alt="wireframe">
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about home that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
                I reserve the right to change anything that might be ugly in the future
			</p>
			<img src="#" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about page 2 that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="#" alt="page 2 wireframe" />
